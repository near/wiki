# Ecosystem Success

### Onboarding projects into the ecosystem&#x20;

The Ecosystem Success (ES) team works with projects to help them find early success in the NEAR ecosystem. This is accomplished via a consultative relationship that leverages a growing list of service providers that can assist projects in a variety of domains. The ES role can be broken down the following primary components:

* Onboard new projects into the program to learn about their plans, needs, and experience
* Host regular check-ins with projects to support them and learn about their experience&#x20;
* Maintain community resources including the ecosystem map and service menu&#x20;
* Coordinate with service providers to help projects remove project blockers&#x20;
* Monitor ecosystem trends, developments and metrics.&#x20;
* Share insights with the NEAR community

### Onboarding - First Contact&#x20;

The checklist below helps the ES team understand a project and it’s needs. After we have this information we can design a follow-up plan.

Onboarding Tip: As much as we want to help, do not over promise (and under deliver!). ES provides the most value by matchmaking projects with service providers. The service providers need to be bought in too, so check with them first!
{% endhint %}

The type of interaction and level of engagement will be guided by the project's [forecasted impact](./#prioritization). We want to use resources strategically and fairly. If a project doesn’t meet our current requirements then we look to the community for support.

### ES Response Goals (Q4 2021)&#x20;

The ecosystem is starting to expand faster than we can track it! This is a good problem that requires us to be strategic with our limited resources. We’ll review these recommendations every quarter while also integrating more community resources. Remember these are recommendations! A project nearing launch will require more support than a project just starting out.
