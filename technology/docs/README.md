# Documentation

NEAR Protocol offers paths for any developers to start building in our ecosystem. If you're joining from web2, then AssemblyScript may be a great place to start. Existing web3 devs may find Rust a more natural fit. Whichever path you choose, you can find the tools, resources, and support to help you journey through the NEARVerse.
