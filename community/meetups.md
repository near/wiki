### Planning&#x20;

#### Agenda Template

* Date + Time
* Venue
* Topic / Speakers
* Opportunities --> CTA
* Relevant Links

#### Safety

Check your local regulations re: COVID - would it be safe to host a meetup?

#### Venue

Options:

* Co-working space or office (good for presentations and workshops)
* Cafe / restaurant / pub (good for social meetups)
* Hotel conference room (good for large meetups)

Before you book:

* Confirm the number of people you would like to invite
* Confirm date, time, and the duration
* Confirm equipment needed (whiteboard, projector, etc.)

_Make sure the venue is booked at least 2-3 weeks before the actual meetup._

#### Speakers

Do you have any speakers in mind? If so, make sure they confirm their attendance weeks in advance, so they can help with promoting your meetup. Once they confirm, please coordinate on logistics once you have the meetup agenda.

#### Food + Drinks&#x20;

Contact local vendors that provide catering services and take care of any logistics.

#### Programming

Have you decided on a topic? If not, here is a list of suggested topics:

* Development
* Use Cases
* Governance
* AssemblyScript
* Interoperability

Once you have confirmed the topic, here is a folder containing various resources you can use for your meetup: workshops, presentations, etc.

#### Event Page

We provide local communities with their own group on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/pro/meetup-group-fvxibqwa), leveraging our Pro account. Alternatively, event organizers may use another solution like [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com).

Tips for a good event description:

* Detailed: give people an idea what your event is about
* Organized: explain things in a clear order, so it will be easy to digest
* Visual: upload a photo or image to give a better feel for the event

Attendees will receive an email automatically when they sign up. You can customize settings to make sure they are properly / sufficiently notified. Ideally, the content would be personalized for your target audience(s).

### Promotion

Craft your message with a link to your event, and begin sharing  ± 3 weeks prior. Be sure to leverage social media, and ideally, collaborators in your guild will help.

You can submit a request for support from the NEAR Marketing Team:

Contact james@near.foundation if you need further support.

### Afterwards

Generally, send an email to thank attendees, and follow up via social media. Specifically, reach out personally to any special “leads” generated, and give NF a heads up if necessary.

### Reporting

Reply to your original forum post with an update on the meetup for accountability. Please include all metrics of success outlined in the proposal. Key results help others understand the value and importance of what you are doing.
