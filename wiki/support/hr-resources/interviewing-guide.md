## Introduction

Finding the right people for your growing team can be a daunting task. What should go into your job description? What should you look for when interviewing? That’s why this guide was created. It will help you answer all your questions, and craft a solid framework for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring strong candidates. 


## Hiring starts with an approved MOC*

Hiring right starts with a clear understanding of what success looks like for a position – and the skills and capability needed to be successful in this role. The Mission, Outcomes and Competencies “MOC” framework is intended to drive the crafting of a great interview process with clear cues for your interviewers and drive a positive experience for everyone involved with great hiring decisions as a result.


---


## TL; DR – MOC (Mission, Outcomes, and Competencies)



* MISSION- Essentially, why does this role exist and what’s the charter? 
* OUTCOMES- What does success look like in the first 12 months?
* COMPETENCIES- What knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed to succeed?

### MOC: Template

This template is designed to help kick start a Job Description (JD) doc by filling in the essence of what we're looking for. It gives internal people and the applicant clarity on why the job is important (Mission), what that person is actually accountable for (Objectives) and what skillsets are critical for us to interview them for along the way (Competencies).

===

Reporting to:_ &lt;Manager Name>_

**Mission**

_What do we need this person to do over the next 12 months (essence of the job in 2­-3 plain English sentences). This isn't a marketing copy, it's just the explanation you'd give over Slack._

**Outcomes**

_What specific outcomes are we looking for this hire to achieve in their first 12-18 months? 5-8 specific and important goals that support the mission, ranked by order of importance; outcomes also influence what needs to report to them to be successful?  Go deeper and also address the problem (s) this person will be solving._



1. 
2.  

**Competencies**

_Flowing out from the mission and outcomes, competencies articulate how we expect this person to operate in achieving the goals. Think about this with two views: 1. How we expect this person to operate in achieving the goals, and 2. What set of experiences/ accomplishments do they have that give them a unique advantage in achieving our outcomes list above? The interview process will be designed so at least 2 people provide signal on each of these._



1. Competency 1: 
2. Competency 2: 

**Interview Plan**

_Which 3-5 people should be part of the interview process for uncovering these competencies and how should that process work?_

## Interview Etiquette 


## Reminders for a great candidate experience :) 

A final word on the interview process. Remember, your candidates are evaluating you just as much as you are evaluating them. First impressions go both ways. These bullet points will help you communicate to your candidates that you value their time, put thought into their role, your project, and your vision. Following these simple etiquette tips will help  you look professional, and help them feel welcome as they advance through the hiring process you create.



* Set up your interviews as soon as you can once responses to your job posting start arriving in your inbox. 
* Be on time for your interview! It’s respectful and shows that you care about them.
* If you need to reschedule your interview, do it at least 24 hours in advance. Don’t reschedule more than once as it can make the candidate feel unimportant.
* Don’t leave the candidates hanging in a zoom alone - although sometimes emergencies happen, it’s important to send them a message directly in these situations. 
* Submit your scorecard to your team within 24 hours of conducting the interview.
