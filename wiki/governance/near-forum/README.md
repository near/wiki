# What is the NEAR Governance Forum?

The [NEAR Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org/) is the living hub of NEAR Ecosystem. Here, NEAR Community members, developers, and the NEAR Foundation team come together to enable ecosystem participants to build something great and expand the NEAR ecosystem.

Much like the NEAR blockchain itself, the forum is completely open, accessible, and transparent. We'd love to have you on board \(if you're not already\) to help build the NEARverse.

One last thing before you run off to [sign up](https://gov.near.org/), do check out the next page for the Forum Guidelines.
