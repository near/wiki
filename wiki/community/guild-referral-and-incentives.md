# Guild Referral and Incentives

Guilds have been instrumental in growing the NEAR ecosystem. From referring interesting projects to build on NEAR to bringing in friends to participate in hackathons, the network effect of this community is huge!

We want to now formalize this process and give you more rewards for inviting your friends, peers, and projects and growing the NEAR ecosystem. Below outlined are the different referral programs available for guilds.

## Grants program

The NEAR Foundation has launched a referral program to help accelerate projects already building on NEAR. For each project referred, you could be in with a chance of winning as much as $10,000 in NEAR for nominating a worthy project. In particular, we’re looking for new projects to build on NEAR or to integrate via Aurora

### How to Refer Projects?

Simply fill out a form on our dedicated referral page, naming the project you want to be nominated, along with the contact details of who we should contact in the event of the grant being awarded.

Any project suitable for our Grants Program will be vetted by our expert team who will assess every application. Please note, projects already funded by the Grants program aren’t eligible, and there can only be one referrer per project on a first-come, first-served basis.
