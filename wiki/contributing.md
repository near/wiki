# Contributing

Wiki content development is community driven, and your contributions are welcome!

## How To Contribute

To contribute, you can use Github repository: https://github.com/near/wiki. You can edit any file there by clicking "Edit this page" (you will need to sign up for Github).

Once logged in, you will be in the editor. The editor allows to edit "Markdown" files - a special formatting used for this Wiki. When you are done with changes, you can describe what have you done in the text field at the bottom.

The next step is to create a Pull Request that will inform Wiki editors to review your changes.

_If you become a frequent contributor, you will be granted "Writer" access in GitBook._
