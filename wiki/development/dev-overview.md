Welcome to the building overview!

This is a guide for project managers, founders, software developers, or anybody else interested in building projects on NEAR.
It contains tools and resources that can improve your experience building projects on NEAR.

## Tools

There are a wide variety of tools available to help you develop your project.
You can start by looking at our [essential tools](./essential-tools.md), the NEAR wallet, the block explorer, and the command-line interface(CLI).
These tools allow you to interface the NEAR protocol in different ways, the NEAR wallet makes it easy to store your NEAR and interact with the NEAR network with a convenient graphical user interface.
The block explorer allows you to see what's happening on the NEAR network on a larger scale, including what transactions are happening, statistics about nodes and blocks, and a historical look at the NEAR network.

For project inspiration, have a look at [AwesomeNEAR](https://awesomenear.com/), which has a large and growing directory of projects built on NEAR.
This can help you understand what projects already exist, and help you determine what you should include in your project.
For developers looking to dive right into a project, have a look at our [documentation](https://docs.near.org) for information about how to build your project.
