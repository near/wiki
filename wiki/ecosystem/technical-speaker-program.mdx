# NEAR Technical Speaker Program (TSP)


### OVERVIEW 

In the Web3 ecosystem, there is an endless stream of events around the globe and the number of events is increasing every year. The demand for NEAR-knowledgeable speakers at these events is high, and our current model of sending core NEARians is not scalable. Thankfully, the NEAR ecosystem is full of knowledgeable, enthusiastic community members (like you!) who are well-versed on the nuances of the NEAR ecosystem. 


### OBJECTIVES

1. Amass a legion of technical (and eventually, non-technical) volunteer speakers to represent NEAR across the globe at events, conferences, meetups, and workshops. 
2. The NEAR TSP will empower and enable these individuals by offering guidelines, public speaking training, and a streamlined set of standards, principles, and content outlines for each speaker. 
3. Later phases will include decentralized content curation/management and collaborative coaching and mentorship models.  


### TSP COHORT INFORMATION

The TSP takes place over 5-6 weeks, with a maximum commitment of 1 hr/wk. Each session ranges from 30-45 minutes with modules led by facilitators and visiting presenters who are expert technical speakers.  

Participants will have a chance to practice and workshop content with their cohort during the program, as well as access to a TSP Alumni Group to tap into for continued support. 


#### MODULES OVERVIEW

The TSP is broken down into the following modules, with the flexibility to add modules or content based on availability and demand.  

[0] **Introduction and TSP Overview:** Meet your fellow cohort members and get acquainted with the TSP  

[1] **Public Speaking 101:** Become a Master of the Stage  

[2] **Technical Presentations:** How to simply present complex concepts  

[3] **CFPs and You:** How to write a talk proposal that organizers won’t be able to refuse  

[4] **Media Training:** Learn what you can and can’t say when representing NEAR  

[5] **[OPTIONAL]  Facilitator Training:** How to train the next generation of NEAR Technical Speakers  

[6] **[OPTIONAL] Q&A Best Practices:** How to talk about NEAR in the wild, without a script  


### DESIRED OUTCOMES

* An engaged and active community of evangelists to represent NEAR across the globe  
* Regularly maintained and easily accessible set of standardized guidelines and “playbooks” for training, content, etc.

#### ROLLOUT PHASES

| Phase | Status | Launch | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **Technical Experts:** SMEs, ecosystem project leaders | <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(212, 237, 188)'}}>Launched</span> | Q1 2023 | The initial phase will seek to identify candidates who are deeply knowledgeable about the NEAR ecosystem–experts within their respective fields. These individuals should require little to no training in terms of subject matter, but may need speaker/media training. These individuals are likely leading NEAR ecosystem projects or are strong community advocates (regional hubs, DAOs, etc.) |
| **Web3 Experts:** web3 and NEAR community leaders |  <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(212, 237, 188)'}}>Launched</span>  | Q2 2023 | The second phase of the rollout will look to equip top contributors within the NEAR ecosystem with the resources and talking points necessary for them to speak on behalf of NEAR across the web3 ecosystem. |
| **NEAR Community Members** |  <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(212, 237, 188)'}}>Launched</span>  | Q3 2023 | The third phase will empower the NEAR Community to represent the NEAR ecosystem across the globe |
| **Regional Experts:** Local community leaders and members |  <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 229, 160)'}}>In Progress</span>  | Q4 2023 | The final stage of the rollout will work with local and regional community leaders to decentralize and take the TSP to the masses |
