## Research Papers

* [Sharding Design: Nightshade](https://near.org/downloads/Nightshade.pdf) - Sharding approach that is focused on sharding blocks instead of chains.
* [Doomslug: block confirmation with single round of communication, and a finality gadget with guaranteed liveness](https://near.ai/doomslug) - Novel consensus algorithm that allows to have super fast blocks with BFT finality.
* [Fast Finality: Proof of Space-Time](https://near.org/papers/proof-of-space-time/) - A design for a fork choice rule, Sybil resistance mechanism and finality gadget that collectively provide fast finality, resistance to long range attacks, and discourage pooling.
* [Economics in Sharded Blockchain](https://near.org/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/) - Paper reviews economic incentive design for sharded blockchains.
