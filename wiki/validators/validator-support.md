# Validator Support

NEAR Foundation has a dedicated team to manage and support validators and the teams who run them.

If you can't find the answer you're looking for in our [technical documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/node/validator/staking-and-delegation#) then the Validator team are here to support you.

You can reach out to the Validator team directly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/z4ak4hA) and [Telegram](https://t.me/near\_validators).

Alternatively, you can share a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nearprotocol).
