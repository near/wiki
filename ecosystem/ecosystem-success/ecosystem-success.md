# Ecosystem Success

### Onboarding projects into the ecosystem&#x20;

The Ecosystem Success (ES) team works with projects to help them find early success in the NEAR ecosystem. This is accomplished via a consultative relationship that leverages a growing list of service providers that can assist projects in a variety of domains. The ES role can be broken down into the following primary components:

* Onboard new projects into the program to learn about their plans, needs, and experience
* Host regular check-ins with projects to support them and learn about their experience&#x20;
* Maintain community resources including the ecosystem map and service menu&#x20;
* Coordinate with service providers to help projects remove project blockers&#x20;
* Monitor ecosystem trends, developments and metrics.&#x20;
* Share insights with the NEAR community

### Onboarding - First Contact&#x20;

The checklist below helps the ES team understand a project and its needs. After we have this information we can design a follow-up plan.

Onboarding Tip: As much as we want to help, do not over-promise (and under deliver!). ES provides the most value by matchmaking projects with service providers. The service providers need to be bought in too, so check with them first!
:::

The type of interaction and level of engagement will be guided by the project's [forecasted impact](./#prioritization). We want to use resources strategically and fairly. If a project doesn’t meet our current requirements then we look to the community for support.

### ES Response Goals (Q4 2021)&#x20;

The ecosystem is starting to expand faster than we can track it! This is a good problem that requires us to be strategic with our limited resources. We’ll review these recommendations every quarter while also integrating more community resources. Remember these are recommendations! A project nearing launch will require more support than a project just starting out.
